# Ludaro_Smartwatch

this is a small hud i made to learn css, html, js and vue, in thanks to a friend called LinuxSystem, this hud will recieve regular upodates, and as of the state of version 1.1 it was made in less then 24 hours, which is alot to consider while using this project, this is my first time using vue, or something similiar and this has turned out pretty great, and im glad i could enjoy this.

and i also released it for free because yeah, its cool yk, and nothing else like this free exists,
